player() returns what turn it is (X always starts first)
actions() returns a set of tuples(row,col) that represent empty tiles in the board
result() returns a copy of the original board after the new move (Deep copy, aka EVERYTHING is a copy)
    note that it takes actions() as argument; invalid action will raise exception
winner() checks the board state and returns X or O if X or O won the game
terminal() checks board and returns true if game is over (check board for draw states, check winner() for win states)
utility() checks a board where the game is over and returns 1 if X won, -1 if O won, and 0 if draw.
minimax() computes the next best move using utility() and general minimax logic and returns tuple of the next best move

player() implementation:
    var counter starts at 0. counter gets updated every time a move is made. if even, X. if odd, O.

actions() implementation:
